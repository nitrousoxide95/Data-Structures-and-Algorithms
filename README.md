# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This is my code bank for important data structures and algorithms. There're two styles avaliable - ICPC style and normal style. ICPC style code is shorter so that I can implement quickly during programming contests, but normal style may fit better for engineering purposes. Feel free to use these code. I'll constantly update my codebank after I learn some new data structures and algorithms.
